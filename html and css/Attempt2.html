			Elizabeth Cady Stanton 
A Darwinian Feminist
Introduction
 “And the rib which the Lord God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man. And Adam said, This is now bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of man.”  
Late nineteenth century American woman’s rights advocate, Elizabeth Cady Stanton (1815-1902), reacts to these lines from the bible stating that they make women “a mere afterthought…The only reason for her advent being the solitude of man.”  In The Woman’s Bible (1895), Stanton admonishes statements in the Bible that support woman’s subordination to man. Her direct criticism of the Bible was one of many responses due to Charles Darwin’s The Descent of Man (1871). Historian Kimberly A. Hamlin states in From Eve to Evolution (2014) that Darwin’s The Descent of Man and On the Origin of Species (1859) established theories of evolution and sexual selection which introduced flexibility to the otherwise patriarchal essentialism in the bible.  The Darwinian feminists , as Hamlin refers to them, were the woman’s rights advocates in late nineteenth century America who used this flexibility to further their arguments.   Hamlin groups Elizabeth Cady Stanton with Darwinian feminists such as Antoinette Louisa Brown Blackwell (1825-1921), Helen Hamilton Gardener (1853-1925), and Charlotte Perkins Gilman (1860-1935).  
Although Hamlin claims that Stanton was a Darwinian feminist, Stanton’s extensive involvement with the woman’s suffrage movement was unique among most other Darwinian feminists. Thus, Stanton’s place among this Darwin-inspired group could easily be questioned. Contrary to Hamlin’s argument, it appears as though Stanton is anomalous among the 1870-1900 American Darwinian feminists because of her emphasis on suffrage. However, a deeper analysis reveals that Stanton’s ideological framework falls in line with other Darwinian feminists thus confirming Hamlin’s assertion. 
Stanton’s Unique Suffrage Motivation
Unlike other Darwinian feminists in 1870s-1890s America, Elizabeth Cady Stanton focused a large amount of effort on the suffrage movement. Hamlin claims that there was a rift between the Darwinian feminists and the suffragists. Suffragists, especially those in the National American Woman’s Suffrage Association (NAWSA), did not write about evolutionary science because they did not want to upset any conservative individuals who may otherwise support suffrage.  On the other hand Darwinian feminists that Hamlin discusses in From Eve to Evolution did not focus their attention on the suffrage movement. Although Antoinette Brown Blackwell helped form the American Woman Suffrage Organization (AWSA), she never became a prominent figure in the suffrage movement because she thought it was too limiting.  As Blackwell biographer Elizabeth Cazden states, Blackwell instead focused her attention on involving women with science in order to establish a women-involved “science of feminine humanity” that would support women entering the labor force.   According to Hamlin, Helen Hamilton Gardener also wasn’t a part of the woman’s rights movement in the 1880s and 1890s because she was instead finding ways to demonstrate that women’s brains were not inferior to men’s.  Furthermore, Charlotte Perkins Gilman wrote Women and Economics: A Study of the Economic Relation between Men and Women as a Factor in Social Evolution (1898), which epitomizes her life goal of helping women gain economic independence and thereby reaching equality with men.  Therefore, she too focused on matters other than suffrage. On the contrary, Elizabeth Cady Stanton put an immense amount of effort into the enfranchisement of women. In the 1848 Seneca Falls Convention, Stanton gave a “Declaration of Sentiments” address, based off of the “Declaration of Independence,” which demanded equal rights for women and officially launched the start of the woman’s suffrage movement.  She also led the National Women Suffrage Association (NWSA) with her good friend, Susan B. Anthony, beginning in 1869.  After merging with AWSA in 1890 to form NAWSA, Stanton also assumed presidency of this suffrage organization until 1892.  Hamlin’s From Eve to Evolution seems to present a contradiction. On the one hand, Hamlin asserts that there was a divergence between the Darwinian feminists and the suffragists, and most of the Darwinian feminists she names are not prominent suffragists. On the other hand Hamlin claims that Elizabeth Cady Stanton is a Darwinian feminist, which makes Stanton’s involvement with the suffrage movement problematic. 
However, a closer look at Stanton’s involvement with the suffrage movement reveals that she is in fact similar to other Darwinian feminists. Even though Elizabeth Cady Stanton supported the woman’s suffrage movement, her effort to publish The Woman’s Bible demonstrates that she was a controversial figure in NAWSA, but was supported by other Darwinian feminists. Initially, Stanton wanted a committee of women to help her write The Woman’s Bible, but suffragists denied her because they were afraid of the anti-suffrage backlash that it might cause. Historian Kathi L. Kern summarizes that in desperation, Stanton began pleading with suffragists to let her use their names without their contributions, and in the end Stanton’s “committee” consisted of just her daughter, one British suffragist, and herself.  However, Stanton used the names of women such as Carrie Chapman Catt, president of NAWSA and Frances Willard, president of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union , without their permission.  By illegitimately using suffragist names, Stanton revealed that she was not receiving support from other suffragists. Kern further writes that when The Woman’s Bible was finally published, it produced an uproar and created huge divisions among the woman’s suffrage movement. 
An 1896 NAWSA meeting was held in direct response to the book’s publication where the corresponding secretary, Rachel Foster Avery, argued that “the work of our Association has been … much hindered by … the so-called The Woman’s Bible.”  Ultimately, the women at the NAWSA convention deliberated over whether or not to disavow Stanton’s work. Stanton’s antireligious ideas were far outside the realm of what most of the other suffragists’ believed. As historian Louise Michele Newman comments, “This incident revealed the internal division within the suffrage movement. Stanton, challenging fundamental religious beliefs, met with active resistance from more conservative and status-conscious women, who considered Stanton’s religious views blasphemous and dangerous to the suffrage cause.”   Elizabeth Cady Stanton therefore received more criticism from the woman’s suffrage movement than she did support. 
	On the contrary, Darwinian feminists agreed with Stanton unlike the more conservative suffragists did. Charlotte Perkins Gilman, who was “perhaps the best-known Darwinian feminist” according to Hamlin, was present at the 1896 NAWSA convention on The Woman’s Bible.   Despite being ill with mumps, Gilman dragged herself to the convention because she did not want NAWSA to disavow Stanton’s work.  This illustrates that Gilman agreed with Stanton. Gilman’s unwavering support for Stanton indicates that Stanton’s ideas were consistent with other Darwinian feminists’.
Stanton the Freethinker
Although Elizabeth Cady Stanton was once religious, after reading Darwin she soon became antireligious, which is a characteristic of Darwinian feminists. As Hamlin concludes in From Eve to Evolution, Darwinian feminists were able to imagine “a world governed by naturalistic and nonpatriarchal laws” after reading Darwin’s evolutionary theory. The feminists’ new imagination implies that the Bible presented a static and patriarchal society that evolution was able to contradict.   Specifically, Elizabeth Cady Stanton herself experienced a transition in religious belief similar to Hamlin’s description of a Darwinian feminist. In the 1870s, before Stanton read Darwin, she gave a speech entitled “The Bible and Woman’s Rights” in which she argued that the Bible could be interpreted to support women’s enfranchisement.   Compared to her later work, especially The Woman’s Bible, it may be a surprise that Stanton had once found peace between religion and the woman’s suffrage movement. The point in which her religious ideas changed can be traced back to 1882 when Stanton wrote in her diary, “I have dipped into Darwin’s Descent of Man…which [has] cleared up many of my ideas on theology and left me more than ever reconciled to rest with many debatable ideas relegated to the unknown.”   Stanton’s entry suggests that despite the content of her speech, she had been questioning some of her religious ideas, and by reading Darwin’s publication, she was able to solidify her beliefs. From then on, her opinions of religion were cynical. In an 1887 letter to her cousin, Stanton writes, “Admit Darwin’s theory of evolution and the whole orthodox system topples to the ground; if there was no Fall, there was no need of a Savior, and the atonement, regeneration and salvation have no significance whatever.”  Informed by Darwin’s scientific theory, Stanton could no longer buy into the claims of Genesis. Just like many other Darwinian feminists, Stanton was not religious. Rather she was a freethinker—an antireligious movement that peaked in the late 1800s in America. 
Specific Darwinian feminists that Hamlin names—such as Helen Hamilton Gardener and Charlotte Perkins Gilman—preferred Darwin’s theory of evolution over Christianity, which further supports Stanton’s similarity to Darwinian feminists. In her 1895 essay entitled “Men, Women and Gods,” Helen Hamilton Gardener contends, “what Moses and David and Samuel taught as the word and will of God, we, who are fortunate enough to live in the same age with Charles Darwin, know to be the expression of a low social condition untampered by the light of science.”  From this quote one can see that Gardener, like Stanton, was a freethinker who used Darwin’s scientific ideas to disregard the Bible’s claims. Furthermore, Gardener writes, “it is always a surprise to me that women will sit, year after year, and be told that, because of a story as silly and childish as it is unjust, she is responsible for all the ills of life.”  In 1896, Stanton wrote a strikingly similar diary entry, in which she asserts, “I believe that if women prefer a run in the open air on Sunday to a prosy sermon in a close church … [then] this worship is far preferable to playing the role of ‘miserable sinners’ in the church service.”  Both Stanton and Gardener are freethinking feminists upset at religion for imposing the role of the “sinner” onto women, and they support women who will abandon the church for other activities. Therefore Stanton’s opinion of religion agrees with Gardener’s, proving that Stanton indeed shares similar religious ideas to at least one Darwinian feminist. 
Additionally, it is appropriate to characterize Stanton as a Darwinian feminist, because her disagreement with the story of Genesis resembles Gilman’s opinion of Genesis. As Hamlin paraphrases, Charlotte Perkins Gilman often considered evolution to be her religion. Specifically, Gilman was initially attracted to evolution because it challenged the story of Adam and Eve.  Gilman believed that the story of Adam and Eve in Genesis imposed a subordinate role onto women, but she insisted that if individuals were informed by Darwin’s theory of evolution, then “all our dark and tangled problems of unhappiness, sin and disease, as between men and women, are cleared.”  The fundamental flaws that Gilman saw in the way that the Bible’s portrayal of women as inferior to man are similar to the opposition to Genesis that Stanton conveyed in The Woman’s Bible. As established in the introduction, Elizabeth Cady Stanton argued that the story of Adam and Eve suggests that women are subordinate to man. Yet Stanton stated in 1891 that if more women read Darwin they would “relegate the allegory to the same class of literature as Aesop’s fables.”  Therefore, Stanton saw Darwin’s theory of evolution as a means of overlooking the patriarchal story of Genesis. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, just like Gilman, believed that Genesis was a male-biased story that affected women in society but could be refuted upon reading Darwin. Hence, Stanton’s freethinking ideas and her disagreement with Genesis are both characteristic traits of a Darwinian feminist. 
Stanton’s Appeal to the Natural World
There is also a trend among Darwinian feminists to appeal to the natural world to justify their feminist arguments, and Elizabeth Cady Stanton did not differ from these Darwinian feminists in this respect. Specifically, Blackwell, Gilman, and Stanton referenced nature in their women’s rights arguments. According to Hamlin, Antoinette Blackwell was inspired and motivated by her personal life experiences. Blackwell’s original goal in life was to become an ordained minister, but met with opposition from both her advisor and others in her community. When she finally became a minister in 1853, Blackwell had already lost faith in Christian orthodoxy and begun to turn her attention to science in order to create an argument in favor of women in the work force, as a response to the challenges she faced in entering the working world.  In The Sexes Throughout Nature (1875), Blackwell argued that evolution was inviting women to develop into something greater than they already were inside of the household, and there was “a broader, not a higher, life outside, which she is impelled to enter, taking some share also in its responsibilities.”  One can see from this quotation that Blackwell used the natural world Darwin described to support her claim that the world was calling women into the work force. 
Furthermore, historian Cynthia Eagle Russet summarizes that Gilman used examples of animals in the natural world to emphasize that only in humans are females dependent on males.  Gilman states, “in other species of animals, male and female alike graze and browse, hunt and kill, climb, swim, dig, run, and fly for their living, in our species the female does not seek her own living…but is fed by the male.”  From this quotation one can see that Gilman turned to examples of animals in nature to assert that males and females are equal in other species because unlike in humans, the females are not dependent on the males. Gilman is then able to use this natural evidence to conclude her main argument that women should gain economic independence so that she may reach equality with man. 
 Similar to both Blackwell and Gilman, when Stanton resigned from NAWSA in 1892, she gave a speech entitled “The Solitude of Self” in which she argued that every individual, both man and woman, is entitled to the same individual rights. She claimed that because “nature, having endowed them equally, leaves them to their own skill and judgement in the hour of danger, and, if not equal to the occasion, alike they perish.”  Thus one can see evidence of Stanton’s reliance on observations of the natural world around her to support woman’s rights as individuals. Stanton referenced nature to assert her claim that women are individuals deserving of individual rights just like how Blackwell and Gilman referenced the natural world to assert their arguments. Thus, Stanton’s appeal to the natural world further supports that Stanton is indeed a Darwinian feminist. 
Many Darwinian feminists also believed that pregnancy could be used as an argument in favor of women’s strength, and Stanton was not a stranger to this idea, which further emphasizes her place as a Darwinian feminist. Hamlin insists that, starting in the 1870s, both Blackwell and Gilman were inspired by Darwin’s theory of evolution and began believe that pregnancy was a “healthy, natural process (as opposed to a disease).”  Since Darwinian feminists did not want pregnancy to hold negative connotations as it sometimes did in society, Blackwell and Gilman asserted that the ability to bear children and remain fit actually made women superior to men.  In a comparable manner, Stanton also held the idea that pregnancy was a sign of strength in women. In an 1889 diary entry, Stanton recalled her response to an inquiry about whether women were physically capable of the vote, to which she reports responding, “If we can carry babies weighing thirty pounds from day to day, I think we can drop a little piece of paper into a ballot-box.”  Through this response, Stanton reveals her opinion that pregnancy is a sign of fitness. This opinion is consistent with the arguments that other Darwinian feminists drew from the natural world, further suggesting that it is appropriate to categorize Stanton as a Darwinian feminist. 
Stanton’s Criticism of Androcentric Science 
Both Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Antoinette Brown Blackwell criticized the claim that males are intellectually superior to females, so one can observe that Stanton was frustrated by the androcentric  and unfounded conclusions made by scientists just as other Darwinian feminists were. Hamlin claims that the biggest problem Darwinian feminists had with science in the late nineteenth century was “that science was being conducted mainly by men, for men, and did not include accurate studies of women.”  For example, Antoinette Brown Blackwell states in The Sexes Throughout Nature that “the facts of Evolution may have been misinterpreted, by giving undue prominence to such as have been evolved in the male line; and by overlooking equally essential modifications which have arisen in the diverging female line.”  It is obvious from this quotation that Blackwell did not agree with all of science’s conclusions, especially those that gave men the upper edge over women. Thus, Blackwell was frustrated by the claim that the male brain was superior to the female brain. As Russet explains that Darwin claimed based “extremely shrewd guesses” as opposed to empirical evidence, Darwin himself argued that female intellect was inferior to males.  Additionally as Hamlin states, when neurologist William A. Hammond claimed throughout the 1870s and 1880s that women’s brains were inferior to men’s brains because women’s brains were smaller, both Blackwell and Stanton retorted with an attack on Hammond’s scientific claims.  Blackwell, for instance, proposed that men had bigger brains because they have to control a bigger body, and women have a more complex nervous system which made up for their smaller brain.  Blackwell’s reactionary argument against Hammond shows that Blackwell was in disagreement with his male-biased conclusion. Also in response to Hammond, Stanton claimed his scientific descriptions of women’s brains were cursory and did not come from as much meticulous scientific attention as other work had.  Because Stanton challenged Hammond in accord with Blackwell, it seems evident that Stanton was also displeased by his androcentric conclusion, just like Blackwell was. Furthermore, in 1888, Darwinian feminist Helen Hamilton Gardener gave a speech entitled “Sex in Brain” in direct response to Hammond, to which Stanton responded positively. After hearing Gardener’s speech, Stanton and Gardener promised each other to donate their brains to science after their death in hopes that researchers would finally examine the brains of eminent women and hopefully realize that male and female brains were equal.   From this example one can see that Stanton supported science in conjunction with other Darwinian feminists, in this case Gardener. She was also just as critical of male-biased conclusions in science as were others like Blackwell and Gardener. Hence, one can further conclude that Stanton’s disagreement with Hammond is in line with other Darwinian feminists’ reactions to him. This one specific example shows that in general, Stanton was frustrated with male-biased conclusions in science just like other Darwinian feminists. 
Conclusion
	Elizabeth Cady Stanton unequivocally fought for the vote throughout her life. Her unwavering passion for woman’s suffrage set her apart from most other Darwinian feminists, who often focused their efforts elsewhere. Yet due to her freethinking ideas, her appeal to the natural world, and her criticism of male-bias in science, Stanton can ultimately be appropriately categorized as a Darwinian feminist in all other ideological ways. We can see from this in depth analysis of Stanton’s role as a Darwinian feminist that one exception to a broad label like “Darwinian feminist” does not necessarily mean that she is unfit for the label. Thus, it appears that the majority of feminists in 1870-1900 America were not always entirely a Darwinian feminists or entirely not. What is important is the extent to which she shares the ideas of other Darwinian feminists, and aside from her focus on suffrage, Stanton is essentially consistent with all other Darwinian feminist characteristics. Hamlin may have presented a questionable claim in asserting that Stanton was indeed a Darwinian feminist, but Stanton definitely has enough in common with other Darwinian feminists to be categorized as one. Historians may always face the challenge of choosing to categorize an individual, but it should be remembered that nobody will ever perfectly fit the description of a single label. For instance, Cazden claims that Blackwell maintained Christian beliefs of marriage, and she insisted that marriage was a sacrament created by God suggesting that Blackwell was not a freethinker.  Although not to the extent that I have analyzed Stanton, I have still shown earlier that Blackwell also shares characteristics of other Darwinian feminists. Therefore it will always be up to the historian to assess the extent to which an individual can be characterized as one thing.
