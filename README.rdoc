To set up the database, run

    rake db:setup
    rake db:migrate

To start the server, run

    rails server

Note: if you do `bundle install`, it may try to update the version of rspotify's dependency
omniauth-oauth2 from 1.3.1 to 1.5.0.  This version of omniauth-oauth2 does not currently work
with rspotify.  You must revert the version of this package back to 1.3.1 in `Gemfile.lock`.
